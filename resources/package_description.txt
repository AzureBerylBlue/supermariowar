Super Mario War is an arcade multiplayer game. The goal is to stomp as many other Mario's as possible to win the game. There are various different gameplay modes in the game, ranging from Capture-The-Flag, King of The Hill, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Tournament Mode, Collect The Coins, Race, and many more.

The game also includes a level editor which lets you create your own maps from scratch, or re-create sections from your favorite Mario game, your imagination is the limit! Recently included is a world editor, which strings a bunch of levels with specified conditions to create an SMB3-like experience merged with tournament like play.

The game uses artwork and sounds from Nintendo games. We hope that this noncommercial fangame qualifies as fair use work. We just wanted to create this game to show how much we adore Nintendo's characters and games.

Have fun!
